Things that need done:
-add settings menu
-add unit return(a list of units that you keep through battles)
-Add function to show loading state when going back to main menu from mod screen
-Add hashtables for checking mod integrety.(will only be used in multiplayer)
--use lua to run custom scripts on maps

/////////////////////////////////////////// Currnetly working on:
/////////////////////////////////////////// working on making unit movement look better, units work, need to fix heroes

-Multiplayer?
-What to do here?
option are:
-Set up server.
-look into steam api for fighting friends
-think i need both. or need to add a friend system to the server?
-Or see if steam has a all users online thingy

-Look into steam stuff that would be needed, like workshop and stuff.

Features to add later
-different terrain like mountains (give something like longer sight range or something)
-add ports and boats, start with carrier and attack boat?
-Add building of walls/city managment (City managment could be done at any time, but will not go into affect tell your next turn)(have builder units for this?)
-add other reasorces
-add tech trees
-add overworld map/gameplay
-add campain editor and some sort of scripting


Bugs:unit movement not correct after build, moves to slow then snaps


- have trigger property to stuff? And a string to define what the trigger is?
EX. grass-trigger:occupied,Conditions:Unit type:Malita, Event:Add gold to units team
trigger:true
TriggeringEvent:Occupied
Condition:type = unit
condition:unit = milita
Event:Add Gold to (unit.team.gold)

Create Seperate script to handle in game scripting

Thoughts
-Have all client side data pulled from json files, and use server to keep integrity through pvp.
--will need to use some seralization for things like hero stats, that way player cant edit them, and then server can use them to check make sure they are not cheating.
