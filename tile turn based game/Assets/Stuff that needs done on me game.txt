Things that need done:
-add settings menu
-Add hero stuff (currently working on this)
--What to do about hero classes? thinking that will be the hero json files and then the art will correlat to a class, that way json can be used to define hero properties

-add xp to troops and a unit return(a list of units that you keep through battles)
-Change roads and water so they only try to update if a tile is changed next to them
-set up animation controller for units, and add files for each state, and controll state from unit/terrain controller script, (Use idle animation to set up the foundation)

--some reeason loading 30 sprites makes it lag, might work better to load all the sprits into a dictionary, and then call them from there, instead of keep loading them over again

-Multiplayer?
-What to do here?
option are:
-Set up server.
-look into steam api for fighting friends
-think i need both. or need to add a friend system to the server?
-Or see if steam has a all users online thingy

-Look into steam stuff that would be needed, like workshop and stuff.

Features to add later
-different terrain like mountains (give something like longer sight range or something)
-add more animations
-add ports and boats, start with carrier and attack boat?

Bugs:
-Archers Range is wronge
